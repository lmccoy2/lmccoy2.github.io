						<p>We moved from Georgia to Pennsylvania a couple months before I was one year old. We came to Camp Hill when I
						was around 3 years old. Since then, I have lived in this same town for most of my life. We have stayed in the same home for around a decade.
						What I like about this town the most is how its very peaceful and friendly and still has many big businesses within it.
